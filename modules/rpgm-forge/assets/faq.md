## Do I need an account?
You can use your own providers without one, but an account enables hosted options and upgrading to the Crafter level membership (which removes daily limits).

## Why did a command return nothing?
Likely no token selected and no subject provided. Select a token or add a subject (e.g., `*description moss-clad ruin`).

## How do I change which AI is used?
Assign providers per generation type in configuration. Names, Descriptions, and Homebrew can each point to different providers.

## Is there an offline mode?
Only Names support the offline provider option (`rpgm-tools-offline`). Other Lore types require an online provider.

## How many name options are generated?
Four per `*name` invocation.

## What does `*homebrew` do?
Opens an interactive wizard to craft custom Lore objects (items, entities, etc.). With a subject, it tailors the schema; without one it selects a preset.

## Does upgrading my membership raise limits?
Upgrading to the Crafter level removes daily generation limits entirely.

## What influences style?
Token or provided context, Language, System, and Genre settings, plus provider-specific behavior.

## What is the Crystal Menu?
A branching crystal-based radial menu that centralizes context-specific Lore actions.

## Can I safely switch providers mid-session?
Yes. Changes apply to new Lore requests immediately.
