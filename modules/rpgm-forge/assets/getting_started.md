> This provides the basics to get you up-and-running quickly.

## Initial Setup
On first launch you will see a setup card to define:
- Language
- System
- Genre

These shape the tone and flavor of generated Lore and can be changed later in Forge Configuration Options.

## (Optional) Create an RPGM Tools Account
An account enables hosted provider usage and upgrading to the Crafter tier, which removes daily generation limits.

## (Optional) Add Providers
Configure providers for each generation type (Names, Descriptions, Homebrew). You can:
- Use hosted defaults (where available)
- Bring your own external AI provider(s)
- Select offline curated list `rpgm-names-offline` (Names only)
- Select adjective combinator `rpgm-names-adjective` (Names only)

## Generate Your First Lore
Select a token and try the following chat commands:
- `*name`
- `*description`
- `*homebrew`

See more detail in Using Forge and provider specifics in Forge Configuration Options.

## Crystal Menu
On the Token HUD, open the Crystal Menu to branch into quick Lore actions.
