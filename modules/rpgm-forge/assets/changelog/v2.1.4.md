### Fixed

- Resolved a regression that caused Foundry to throw `DataCloneError` when other modules injected custom sidebar tabs. The RPGM tab now adjusts the registry in-place so third-party tabs remain intact.

### Improved

- Ensured the RPGM sidebar button always anchors immediately before the Settings tab while preserving every other tab’s original order.
- Allow Archivist Sync and similar modules to toggle their own tabs without losing spacing or visibility during setup wizards.
