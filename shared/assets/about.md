RPGM Tools streamlines tabletop creativity, embedding fast Lore generation and organization directly into your session. Forge uses your Language, System, and Genre context to keep output thematically aligned while you retain full narrative control.

## Philosophy
Assist, accelerate, and inspire without overriding human judgment. Every piece of generated Lore is a springboard, not a mandate.

## Design Pillars
- Context Aware: Outputs shaped by campaign settings.
- Modular: Plays well alongside other Foundry modules.
- Extensible: Provider-per-type architecture and the expanding Crystal Menu support future growth.
